Boosting Ensemble Method
Boosting is a general ensemble method that creates 
a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers.

This is done by building a model from the training data, 
then creating a second model that attempts to correct 
the errors from the first model. 
Models are added until the training set is 
predicted perfectly or a maximum number of models are added.

AdaBoost was the first really successful boosting algorithm 
developed for binary classification. 
It is the best starting point for understanding boosting.

Modern boosting methods build on AdaBoost, 
most notably stochastic gradient boosting machines.
